# Public Health Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook explores public health data using machine learning techniques to uncover insights into health outcomes. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The project focuses on predictive analytics for key public health indicators.

## Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and preparing datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key trends and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Training and evaluating predictive models.
- **Interpretation of Results:** Assessing model performance and public health implications.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Usage:
Due to its size, Github doesn't render the notebook, it can be downloaded and run locally, or accessed on this link
